# Simple-Todo-Android

In this ToDo you have to implement a simple game. The game consists of 3 screens: Level 1, Level 2, and Result
1-      In level 1 put two buttons near each other num1 and num2
2-      Create three buttons in a row result1, result2, result3
3-      Create text view to should score
4-      Generate random numbers in num1 and num2.  The random numbers should be between 0 and 20. 
5-      Add the two numbers
6-      Put the result on one of the three result buttons randomly
7-      The other two buttons should be random and not equal to the result (+/- 2)
8-      You create random numbers (num1 and num2) when you run the app and every time the user answers (once he clicked a result)
9-      Increment score1 for each correct answer and decrement the score for each false answer
10- send a message for every correct/incorrect answer (“correct”) or ("incorrect")
11- after 60 seconds the game goes to level 2 which similar to level 1 but now the numbers are between 0 and 100, the operation is minus, the wrong answers are within (+/- 3) and it has its own score (score2) 
12- After another 60 seconds the game goes to the result screen where it shows the result of each level and the total.
